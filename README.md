# A Comparative Analysis of Mutational Profiles in Clonal Hematopoiesis and Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients

## Overview

Welcome to the supplementary repository for my thesis project, focused on unraveling the complexities of unique mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 genes within clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) populations. This repository serves as a comprehensive backup of the project, providing access to the code, data, and supplementary materials used throughout the research. **It is important to note that this repository is not intended as a verified pipeline or research method, but rather as a supporting resource for my thesis.**

## Objectives

The core aim of this project is to deepen our understanding of how specific mutations in the epigenetic regulatory genes DNMT3A and TET2 contribute to the development and progression of CH and AML. By systematically identifying and documenting these mutations, we aim to uncover distinct patterns and trends that could serve as biomarkers for early detection, prognosis, and therapeutic targets in hematologic malignancies.

Our research delves into the following key areas:

1. **Mutation Identification and Analysis**: Documenting specific mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 genes and performing statistical analysis to reveal unique trends or hotspots within CH and AML populations.
2. **Exploration of Mutation Types**: Investigating various mutation types such as point mutations, insertions, and deletions, and their roles in molecular clonal expansion and leukemogenesis.
3. **Origins and Spread of Mutations**: Studying the potential environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors influencing mutation occurrence and dispersion in DNMT3A and TET2 genes.
4. **Machine Learning Classifier Development**: Creating and testing a machine learning classifier to differentiate between CH-like and AML-like mutations, aiding in early diagnosis and accurate mutation sorting.
